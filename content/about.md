I am a wildlife biologist interested in the natural history, behavioral ecology, and conservation of free-ranging animals. I earned my Ph.D. from Princeton University’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in 2014. There I studied the maternal and antipredator behavior of Thomson’s gazelle, a small East African antelope. For that project I spent many months working at the beautiful Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya. I adore field biology and enjoy the challenges of designing and executing projects in unpredictable environments.

After completing my Ph.D., I spent a year teaching undergraduate courses and working as a research associate in Princeton’s EEB Department. In summer 2016 I started my current position in the Couzin lab in the [Department of Collective Behavior](http://www.collectivebehaviour.com/) at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour](http://www.ab.mpg.de/) where I am a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow. I am using drones and computer vision technologies to study collective predator detection and information transfer in ungulate groups (see the [Herd Hover](http://www.herdhover.com/). project website).

Outside of research, my interests include cooking, scuba diving, swimming, photography, adventurous foods, and travel.
