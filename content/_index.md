I am an ecologist interested in wildlife behavioral ecology, particularly as it pertains to social behavior and antipredator tactics. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Collective Behavior](http://www.collectivebehaviour.com/) at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour](http://www.ab.mpg.de/) and the Department of Biology at the University of Konstanz in Germany, and an affiliate member of the [Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/). I am using [state-of-the-art technologies to study collective predator detection and information transfer in savanna ungulate groups](http://www.herdhover.com/). I earned my Ph.D. at Princeton University in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, where I studied the maternal and antipredator behavior of Thomson’s gazelles. After graduate school, I served as a lecturer for undergraduate courses in Princeton’s EEB Department before beginning my current position.

On this site you’ll find information regarding my research activities, as well as some photos from my fieldwork. Be sure to check out the blog, where you’ll find my latest news and updates.
